# Youtube audio extractor

Get the audio of a Youtube video in a desired language. Say you see a Youtube video with potential, 
you wanna clone the idea but in different language/voice for your own channel, this is the tool for you. 
Directly translate from original audio to desired lang/voice audio is a big challenge, 
so I take the work-around path and translate via subtitle.

This together with auto videos from [TODO](https://github.com/username/awesome-tool) (Subway Surfer video generator)
and [TODO](https://github.com/username/awesome-tool) (Roblox video generator) allows you to build/test mass amount
of channels/ideas
